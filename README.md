# JavaScript Garden

This week we'll be diving into the world of gardening while learning JavaScript basics. You'll be simulating tasks related to plant care and maintenance using JavaScript variables, conditionals, and loops.

## Assignment

As always, start by forking and cloning this repository from GitHub. Open the code in VSCode to get started.

Remember to open the browser console to see the output of your JavaScript code as you go.

### Files Provided

You'll be working with the following files:

- [ ] *garden.js* (Assignment with instructions can be found here)
- [ ] *index.html* (You can put any questions you have in this file)

The `garden.js` file contains comments with prompts on what code to write. Do not erase the comments, just write the code below each commented line.

**NOTE:** The `garden.js` file is already linked to `index.html`.
